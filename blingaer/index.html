  <a href="/blingaer">blingaer</a> is a <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resouce Locator">URL</abbr>
  shortener engine powered entirely by Java and designed to run only on the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>
  that allows anyone to host their very own service.
</p>
<p>
  Inspired by the open source <a href="http://yourls.org">YOURLS</a> and the mainstream
  <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> shorteners available
  <a href="/blingaer">blingaer</a> is designed to utilize the power of <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Google App Engine">GAE</abbr>
  to provide a unique scalable <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
  shortener service to the masses. With an integrated <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>
  external applications and/or users can easily communicate with <a href="/blingaer">blingaer</a>
  to bring a simple and professional user experience.
</p>
<p>
  Although development on this project has really only just begun a lot has been
  completed already and new ideas are still emerging. Eventually, the aim is to
  create a <a href="/blingier">more generic Java engine</a> that is not dependent
  on the <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Google App Engine">GAE</abbr> environment but
  for now concentration is definately on <a href="/blingaer">blingaer</a>.
