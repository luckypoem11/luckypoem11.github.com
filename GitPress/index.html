  <a href="/GitPress">GitPress</a> is a <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>
  plugin that allows users to integrate information from their open source projects
  hosted on <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> in to their blogs. The plugin
  provides widgets and shortcodes which you can customize to suit your own needs.
</p>
<p>
  This project is still in the planning stage and development has not yet started
  but I'm hoping to very soon.
