<h3><a name="reason"></a>Why create this extension?</h3>
<p>
  Although I respect and support <a href="http://wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a> and
  their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative">fight against <abbr rel="tooltip" title="Stop Online Piracy Act">SOPA</abbr></a>,
  I found myself lost without it so I created this workaround, which I thought
  I would then share with the world.
</p>
<p>
  The extension has been designed in such a way that any future blackouts could
  easily be bypassed with few changes.
</p>
<h3><a name="permissions"></a>Why do you need this permission...?</h3>
<p>
  I've seen people commenting a lot on extensions in the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore">Chrome Web Store</a>
  about the permissions required by that extension. Most of these comments are
  negative and usually posted by people who do not fully understand the creation
  of Chrome extensions. For this reason I have <a href="/UndoWikipediaBlackout/permissions">created a breakdown</a>
  of the permissions used by <a href="/UndoWikipediaBlackout">Undo Wikipedia Blackout</a>.
  However, if you have trust issues and don't trust that summary why not <a href="https://github.com/neocotic/UndoWikipediaBlackout">look at the code</a>
  and see for yourself.
</p>
<h3><a name="languages"></a>How can I get Undo Wikipedia Blackout in a different language?</h3>
<p>
  Currently, this extension is only provided in the English but I am hoping to
  support more languages in the future. I am currently working on a method of allowing
  others to easily submit translations and I will update this space when it is
  available.
</p>
<h3><a name="updating"></a>Why isn't Chrome updating Undo Wikipedia Blackout?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://google.com/chrome">Chrome's</a> update frequency is slightly
  unpredictable (at least in my eyes) and I've found that sometimes it updates
  my extensions as soon as an update becomes available but I've also seen it some
  extensions not getting updated even when using the browser for hours. However,
  there is a little-known way (at least to non-developers) to force it to update
  your extensions;
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the Extensions page via on of the following methods;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Main Menu: Tools &gt; Extensions</li>
    <li>
      Address Bar: <a href="chrome://chrome/extensions">chrome://chrome/extensions</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      Right-click <a href="/UndoWikipediaBlackout">Undo Wikipedia Blackout's</a>
      toolbar icon and select <em>&quot;Manage extensions...&quot;</em>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Ensure that <em>&quot;Developer mode&quot;</em> in the top right of the page
    is checked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the <em>&quot;Update extensions now&quot;</em> button, et viola!
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Your extensions should now be receiving updates (where available) and you may
  notice some extensions turning off and on again. If an extension requires any
  additional permissions that you have not already authorized it will not be turned
  back on until you have granted these permissions.
